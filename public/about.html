<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Being born into a family of computer scientists, it's no surprise that I was drawn to the world of technology and coding. </p>

<p>For me, coding is both a hobby and a job, and I feel it's where I can find my greatest fulfilment. I really like creativity, which I think is one of the tenets of this profession.</p>
